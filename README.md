Slacky is a clone of slack.com. The site allows registered users to communicate with others through a channel or private messages. A registered user can create channels of their particular topic, add members, modify the created channel and delete as needed. Members can also choose to make modifications or leave the channel. Members of a channel can send messages and see everyone else messages in the channel. The instant direct message are private and user-to-user specific.
